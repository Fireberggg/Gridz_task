Hello. This is coffee hub website. Its supposed to be a company, which sells coffee & also deliver. I used the grid from the example (maybe a bit resized in width, because of content). I also used some grids and flexboxes in any container, in which it would have been a good solution. All scss files separated in 4 groups : abstract (vars, mixins), base (basic markup, etc.), components (basically all the components on the page). Layout (main components, which should be reused if i implement router to this website). There is also .gitignore file in which i prevent node_modules from pushing on repository.
